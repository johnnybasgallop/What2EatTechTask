Here is my Tech task project for We3World.

Its a recipe suggestion app, it allows for unlimited regenerationsand provides a link to a youtube tutorial for each recipe.

My main goal for this project was to keep things simple, i used theMealDB API: https://www.themealdb.com/api.php as my data resource.
I implemented a MVVM structure and kept the UI clean and minimilistic.
I wrote tests for the critical functions in the View Models.

No external libraries or packages used.
